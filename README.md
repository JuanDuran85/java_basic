# Java Projects and Exercises

This repository is a collection of Java projects, exercises, and examples, covering a range of topics from basic concepts to more advanced applications using frameworks like Spring Boot.

## Projects

The projects are organized into the following categories:

### Basic Theory

This section includes projects that demonstrate fundamental concepts in Java.

-   **BasicTheory**: A collection of modules covering:
    -   `ArrayMethods`: Demonstrates usage of methods in `java.util.Arrays`.
    -   `ConditionsLoops`: Examples of conditional statements and loops.
    -   `DataIn`: How to handle user input.
    -   `FilesManage`: Examples of file manipulation (creating, reading, writing).

    -   `Operators`: Usage of various operators in Java.
    -   `Others`: Covers various other topics like Collections, Exceptions, Interfaces, etc.
    -   `StringMethods`: Demonstrates common methods for string manipulation.
    -   `VariablesDataType`: Examples of variables and data types.

### Design Patterns

    -   Strategy
    -   Observer
    -   Decorator
    -   Factory

### Examples

-   **Example01 - Example06**: A series of small, standalone examples demonstrating various Java features.
-   **RandomNumberExample**: An example of how to generate random numbers in Java.

### Applications

-   **SnackMachine** & **SnackMachineNew**: Two versions of a snack machine application. `SnackMachineNew` is a more structured version with a clear separation of concerns.

### Spring Boot Applications

This section includes several applications built using the Spring Boot framework.

-   **appdemo**: A demo Spring Boot application.
-   **contacts**: A "Contacts System" application using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, Thymeleaf, and MySQL.
-   **employees**: An application for managing employees, using Spring Boot, Spring Data JPA, and JSPs.
