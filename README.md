## Stack and Heap Memory
Java Heap space is used by java runtime to allocate memory to Objects and JRE classes. Whenever we create an object, 
itâ€™s always created in the Heap space.

references to other objects in the heap that is getting referred from the method. Stack memory is always referenced in 
LIFO (Last-In-First-Out) order.
