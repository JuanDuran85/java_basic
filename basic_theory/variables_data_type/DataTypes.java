         * A primitive data type specifies the type of a variable and the kind of values
         * it can hold.
         * There are eight primitive data types in Java: byte, short, int, long, float,
         * double, char, and boolean.
         * long longType = 6546435464346463464L; // The letter 'L' is used to denote a
         * long integer.

         * - Non-Primitive Data Types
         * Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to
         * objects.
         *
         * The main differences between primitive and non-primitive data types are:
         * - Primitive types in Java are predefined and built into the language, while
         * non-primitive types are created by the programmer (except for String).
         * - Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain
         * operations, whereas primitive types cannot.
         * - Primitive types start with a lowercase letter (like int), while
         * non-primitive types typically starts with an uppercase letter (like String).
         * - Primitive types always hold a value, whereas non-primitive types can be
         * null.
         *
         * Examples of non-primitive types are Strings, Arrays, Classes etc. You will
         * learn more about these in a later chapter.
