        /*
         *
         * Variable names are case-sensitive. A variable's name can be any legal
         * identifier â€” an unlimited-length sequence of Unicode letters and digits,
         * beginning with a letter, the dollar sign "$", or the underscore character
         * "_". The convention, however, is to always begin your variable names with a
         * letter, not "$" or "_". Additionally, the dollar sign character, by
         * convention, is never used at all. You may find some situations where
         * auto-generated names will contain the dollar sign, but your variable names
         * should always avoid using it. A similar convention exists for the underscore
         * character; while it's technically legal to begin your variable's name with
         * "_", this practice is discouraged. White space is not permitted.
         *
         * Subsequent characters may be letters, digits, dollar signs, or underscore
         * characters. Conventions (and common sense) apply to this rule as well. When
         * choosing a name for your variables, use full words instead of cryptic
         * abbreviations. Doing so will make your code easier to read and understand. In
         * many cases it will also make your code self-documenting; fields named
         * cadence, speed, and gear, for example, are much more intuitive than
         * abbreviated versions, such as s, c, and g. Also keep in mind that the name
         * you choose must not be a keyword or reserved word.
         *
         * If the name you choose consists of only one word, spell that word in all
         * lowercase letters. If it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first
         * letter of each subsequent word. The names gearRatio and currentGear are prime
         * examples of this convention. If your variable stores a constant value, such
         * as static final int NUM_GEARS = 6, the convention changes slightly,
         * capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore
         * character. By convention, the underscore character is never used elsewhere.
         *

        /*
         * The var keyword allows a variable to be initialized without having to declare its type. The type of the variable depends on the type of the data that is being assigned to it.
         * Where it can be used?
         * You can use var to declare a variable. 
         * You can use var when declaring variable in for loop statement.
         * You can use var with try-with-resources statement.
         * Where it cannot be used?
         * You cannot declare a local variable using var without initialising it or with null value. This is because var needs to know what data type it is assigning to a variable.
         * You cannot use var for declaring instance fields, static fields, declaring a lambda expression, parameters for constructors or methods, method return types and generic types.
         * When you want same type of variable for an object of same inheritance hierarchy, then in that case also, var is not recommended to be used.

         * objects.
         *
         * The main differences between primitive and non-primitive data types are:
         * - Primitive types in Java are predefined and built into the language, while
         * non-primitive types are created by the programmer (except for String).
         * - Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain
         * operations, whereas primitive types cannot.
         * - Primitive types start with a lowercase letter (like int), while
         * non-primitive types typically starts with an uppercase letter (like String).
         * - Primitive types always hold a value, whereas non-primitive types can be
         * null.
         *
         * Examples of non-primitive types are Strings, Arrays, Classes etc. You will
         * learn more about these in a later chapter.
